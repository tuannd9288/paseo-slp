# Paseo SLP repo onboarding

Configure tactics in .paseo-slp/WORKSPACE_PROTOCOL.md and Peer runtime options in
.paseo-slp/slp-routing.json. Supervisor/Lead use saved slp-supervisor/slp-lead
profiles. Peer uses the project pool, falling back to the user-scope catalog
($PASEO_HOME/slp-routing.json, default ~/.paseo) when the repository has none;
no saved slp-peer profile is
needed. Engineer, Architect and Reviewer are dispositions of the same Peer role.

## Establish context

Resolve the assigned repository and host. Read AGENTS.md, existing protocol/pool
and relevant project scripts/docs. Locate installed bin/slp.mjs and read its
src/templates/WORKSPACE_PROTOCOL.md and src/references/provider-routing.md.
Missing installation is a prerequisite; onboarding does not grant host installation
or saved-profile edits. Preserve existing Human choices and unrelated work.

Read Paseo list_profiles/list_providers and discover models/settings. Verify the
saved Supervisor/Lead profiles use matching installed role providers and selected
models. Ask Human to configure missing/incompatible fields in Paseo Agent profiles;
report exact IDs/mismatches, and hand the Human the fix steps: Settings → the host
running the work → Agents → Agent profiles → edit the profile → pick the matching
`slp-{family}-{role}` provider, Model, Thinking, Mode → Save. There is no CLI or
MCP write path for profiles — do not hand-edit the daemon config. Do not create or
require slp-peer.

For the Peer pool, discover slp-pi-peer/slp-codex-peer/slp-devin-peer and their exact models,
thinking/mode/features. Then interview the Human: they decide; you supply
discovered facts and write what they pick. Ask in plain terms — name the files
and what each choice does. For example:

> Peers need a list of which provider/model they may run as. Init seeded this
> repo's `.paseo-slp/slp-routing.json` with task-type seats (lightweight-recon,
> standard-coding, deep-reasoning, independent-second-opinion,
> autonomous-long-running) — each disabled until it gets a real model found on
> this host. Or the repo can share your user-level list at
> `~/.paseo/slp-routing.json` (currently <state>) — every repo without its own
> list falls back to it, so choosing it means deleting the repo file. Which do
> you want?

For a repo pool, walk the seeded seats together: which discovered provider,
model and settings fill each seat, which seats to drop or add — the seed is a
starting set the Human reshapes freely. For the shared list, run the same walk
against `~/.paseo/slp-routing.json`; writing outside the repository needs an
explicit Human grant. A populated user-scope catalog is the fallback default,
not this repository's configuration — its existence never substitutes for the
Human's choice.

The interview is complete when the Human has named where the list lives and,
for a list meant to work, picked discovered options seat by seat — or declared
the repo deliberately without a pool (then strip the seeded seats, leaving
`options: []`). Record the resolved intent — `pinned`, `inherit` or `empty` —
in the protocol frontmatter `routing_intent` with who decided and when; the
catalog file carries the option IDs. In the same pass, ask the workflow
communication language — covering reports, assignments and handbacks between
agents and replies to the Human — and write it into `communication_language`.
Before setup, ask the Human to name each shared heavy resource, choose its
existing lock primitive or small local lock, and set its lock path and bounded
wait policy. Record each named resource and its one lock path in the protocol;
every worktree and Lead uses that path. Do not add a queue service, daemon or
universal database policy.

Within granted setup authority, populate the choices the Human made; otherwise
ask for the missing pool decision before delegation. Offer only providers,
models and settings that live discovery returned — never invent IDs, capability
claims or suitability guarantees. Existing saved Peer settings may be shown as
a migration suggestion but are not automatically imported or a launch fallback.
Never store credentials in the repository.

## Set up protocol and pool

Use `node <slp-cli> init <absolute-repo>` to preview, then --apply within setup
authority. Init creates missing protocol, seeds the task-type skeleton catalog
and a `.paseo-slp/notebook.md` Supervisor notebook scaffold without overwriting
existing files. Fill the frontmatter `supervisor_notebook` field — the scaffolded path with
its owner, or `timeline:<agentId>` plus a retrieval note the Human can follow.
Complete tactics: task classes, ownership, topology, proof, budget,
allowed operations, escalation and settlement. Record each named shared heavy
resource with its one lock path in the protocol; every worktree and Lead uses
that path. Keep role bytes out of the protocol.

The default pool decision is inherit: a repository with no catalog resolves the
user-scope catalog automatically. Any catalog file in the repo is authoritative
— when the Human chooses inherit, remove the seeded slp-routing.json so the
fallback engages. Then check the user-scope file: if it still holds only the
seeded skeleton, offer to populate it from the same discovered options (with
the Human's grant to write outside the repository) or report that the
inherited pool is currently empty.

Populate the project catalog only when the Human chose a pinned pool, before Peer
delegation. Interview the Human on which options to enable, priority and quota
fallback rather than copying a catalog verbatim; --routing-from imports an
explicitly selected source as a starting point for that decision, not as the
decision itself. Every option has:

- id: unique lowercase identifier; provider: pi, codex or devin; exact discovered
  model. Devin options accept swe-2 models only.
- roles: ["peer"]; enabled: boolean; availability: ready, paused, quota-exhausted
  or unknown. Only enabled/ready options may launch.
- Optional thinkingOptionId, modeId and features, verified for that runtime.
- priority: numeric preference; suitableFor and avoidFor: lists of task descriptions;
  notes: concrete guidance/tradeoffs for Lead. Priority is not automatic selection.

Configure quotaFallback: { enabled: false, optionIds: [] } by default. Enable it
only under Human fallback authority; optionIds must reference existing pool options.
Choose allowed fallback options by suitability and budget, not provider model lists.
Preserve existing fallback preferences on updates. Missing settings mean no fallback.

The catalog envelope is version: 1, a nonempty policy describing selection/budget
boundaries, and options: an array of these bundles. Lead chooses an option per
assignment; do not hard-code Engineer/Architect/Reviewer to one model. Multiple
options may use the same provider with different model/settings, or different
providers. Both Peer wrappers load the same policy.

Validate with `node <slp-cli> routes <absolute-repo>`. It returns the catalog hash
and complete options. For each intended eligible option, use prepare with
role: "peer", repository, workspaceId, assignment, fresh providers, and
route: { optionId, catalogSha256 } to inspect launch arguments without creating
an agent. Verify the wrapper/model/settings match the option. Include profiles
only if useful for discovery; they never select or override the Peer runtime.

An empty catalog is valid init output but incomplete Peer onboarding — it also
remains authoritative and shadows the user-scope catalog until removed. Report no
eligible option as unresolved setup, not success. Preserve existing pool entries
and Human preferences on updates; edit only the authorized scope. --routing-from
imports an explicitly selected source only into a missing catalog. The user-scope
catalog is the only declared fallback, resolved automatically when the repository
has none; never read another repository's catalog. No automatic import from retired
profile bindings occurs during host upgrade.

## Verify and hand back

Record actual profile/provider discovery, pool validation, eligible choices and
exact changed files. Confirm protocol describes who may maintain the pool and
whether/how Lead may select quota alternatives. Distinguish no option from no
provider access. Report unresolved decisions precisely. Live launches require
separate task authority; local preparation is not E2E acceptance.

For layout migrations, reconcile collisions before moving files. Install this
skill separately in native project/user scope, not inside .paseo-slp.
